## APCS 
Alright so a brief summary of this github rep. It is basically all the APCS and/or CollegeBoard assignments. To navigate just go to either the ComputScholar or CollegeBoard folder and go to your selected Chapter/Test/Assignment. Thats pretty much it. Another important thing is some assignments mostly the activities for ComputScholar ask to put your name so when looking at the code switch the "FULL NAME" with your name. Well thats it, have fun!! 

## ChangeLog
